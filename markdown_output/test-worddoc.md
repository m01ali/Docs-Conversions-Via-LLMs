**Test Doc**

**Title:** Docs-to-md-via-LLMs

**Description:** This tool converts documents (like PDFs, HTML, and more) into markdown using advanced language models. It's built around Microsoft's MarkItDown utility for better formatting and compatibility.

**Before Image 1** Here is a snapshot of the tool's GUI interface:

**After Image 1** The GUI allows you to load, convert, and save documents with just a few clicks.

**Before Image 2** This is how the markdown output looks after conversion:

**After Image 2** Notice how the structure, formatting, and even images are retained cleanly in the markdown output.
